Yet another hello-world repo :-)

Hi all, As you can guess I'm new to all this however GitHub is Soooooooo!!!! Freeeeaaaakking!!!!! AMAZING!!!

Wish Id got involved with this years ago but TBH I was a bit scared of GitHub and feeling like a turd if I couldn't figure it out.
Now I've played with and succesfully built computers for years but normally got frustrated with the software and coding side and often times ended up firing up my favorite game of the moment and got lost in another world.

Roll on to the present and I am happily learning the BASH CLi, learning more and more each day about Linux (as it is now my sole OS) and when I'm content with that I will look into other languages to explore.

Many thanks for reading,
This article was bought to you in an attempt (a succesfull one I might add) to understand creating branches and commiting changes.

Sinbad.
